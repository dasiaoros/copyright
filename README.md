<p> My opinion on copyright is that when a person creates a work of their own they should be protected.
If a person does not want to share there creation for people to use/ share then they shpuld be able to keep it for themself.
If a person does not care they should at least be recognised as the person who came up with the idea when others use their work.</p>
